#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Build a branch carrying CODE ONLY from $SRC into $TGT.
#
# Used for BOTH directions of the flow:
#   forward  (promote.yml)   dev -> qa -> main, plus the dev -> main override
#   backward (backmerge.yml) main -> qa, main -> dev, and qa -> dev, so a commit
#                            made directly on main or a promotion fix on qa does
#                            not leave the lower branches permanently behind.
# One script for both on purpose: the VERSION pinning and conflict handling
# below are the fiddly part, and a second copy of them would drift.
#
# VERSION is branch-owned: every tracked VERSION file is pinned to $TGT's value
# and then advanced one step, so a version set on the source branch NEVER leaks
# across (dev at 10.00 does not make qa 10.00 -- qa goes 1.45 -> 1.46).
# Pinning also resolves the VERSION merge conflict that would otherwise stall
# every promotion PR. Any other conflict is left for a human.
#
# Env: SRC, TGT, BR, and optional LABEL (wording only -- "promote"/"backmerge").
#      PROMOTE_SPLIT=1 promotes ONE unit of work at a time (see below).
# Writes changed=true/false to $GITHUB_OUTPUT if set.
#
# SPLIT PROMOTION (PROMOTE_SPLIT=1)
# ---------------------------------
# By default this merges all of $SRC in one go, so a promotion PR arrives
# carrying every change that accumulated since the last one -- a 22-file diff
# spanning unrelated pieces of work. That is bad for the thing that actually
# gates promotion: review. A reviewer given one enormous diff cannot hold it
# all, and the skeptical-review panel demonstrably ran out of its file-fetch
# budget on exactly these PRs and rejected them for "could not verify X" rather
# than for anything wrong with the code.
#
# With PROMOTE_SPLIT=1 the promotion is cut back to the ORIGINAL units of work.
# The cut points are $SRC's FIRST-PARENT commits, which is precisely the list of
# things that landed on the branch: one entry per merged PR, one entry per
# direct push. The oldest un-promoted unit is chosen and the merge stops there.
#
# The unit is reached with an ordinary `git merge <ancestor-of-SRC>` rather than
# by cherry-picking it onto $TGT. That distinction is the whole reason this is
# safe: a cherry-pick of unit 3 without units 1 and 2 conflicts whenever they
# touched the same lines, while merging an ancestor of $SRC carries its history
# with it and conflicts no more than today's all-at-once merge does. Units are
# therefore promoted strictly in the order they landed.
#
# A unit that turns out to be a content no-op against $TGT is SKIPPED, not
# promoted. Without that this deadlocks: version-bump.yml commits VERSION-only
# changes to $SRC, VERSION is pinned back to $TGT's value below, so such a unit
# produces no diff at all -- and every subsequent run would keep selecting the
# same stuck unit, promote nothing, and never reach the real work behind it.
